# fugue-field-demo-kit

This is  a colleciton of useful Ludwig scripts for demos centralized into one repo. Putting lots of useful compositions in one repo makes running demos easier on both the presenter and audience in minimizing navigation and context-switching.

**NOTE: THESE ARE LIKELY NOT THE LATEST VERSIONS** as they are sourced from http://docs.fugue.co fake book repos. I'll attempt to keep them up-to-date but always look to those individual repos for the true latest.
